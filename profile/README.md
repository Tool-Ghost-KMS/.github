**KMS Activation Emulation:**

Ghost KMS simulates the behavior of a KMS server and can activate products like Windows and Microsoft Office that are designed to be activated via a KMS server, by bypassing the normal activation process.

**Multiple Product Activation:**

It supports a wide range of Microsoft products, including various versions of Windows (e.g., Windows 7, 8, 10, 11) and Microsoft Office (e.g., Office 2013, 2016, 2019, Office 365).

**Offline Activation:**

Ghost KMS can work in offline mode, meaning that it does not require an internet connection to activate the product.

**Permanent Activation:**

The activation process might provide permanent activation, especially for the versions of Windows and Office designed to work with KMS activation.

**User-Friendly Interface:**

The tool generally provides an easy-to-use interface for initiating activation, often involving simple clicks to start the process.

**No Need for Product Keys:**

Ghost KMS can activate Microsoft products without the need for a traditional product key, which can be beneficial for users who do not have access to valid keys.

**Activation Recheck:**

Some versions of Ghost KMS might have the capability to recheck activation status periodically to ensure the product remains activated.

**Compatibility with Multiple Versions:**

The tool typically works with a wide variety of Windows and Office versions, making it flexible for different user needs.

**Important Notes:**

Legality and Ethics: Ghost KMS and similar tools are often used to bypass licensing mechanisms and can lead to violations of software licensing agreements. It's important to be aware that using such tools for activating software without purchasing valid licenses is illegal and unethical.

**Security Risks:** Downloading or using unauthorized activation tools may expose your system to malware, as these tools can come from unreliable sources.

For legitimate use, it's always best to purchase valid licenses for software to ensure both legal compliance and the safety of your devices.
